To run the code `final.ipynb`, make sure that the `file_path` that is in the second cell of the notebook is the right one depending on where the `train.csv`, `test.csv` and `sample_submission.csv` files are. The `submision.csv` file will be exported in that same directory, to modify it's name, change it in the last cell of the notebook.

The notebook `complementary_code.ipynb` contains the training, of all 8 tested models, their hyper-tuning using the validation set, the retraining with the tuned hyper-parameters and evaluation.
